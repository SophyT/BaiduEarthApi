# A simple usage of Baidu Api 

This is a homework for the course Communications and Networking.

I have to say that index.html can only be opened with IE or Firefox. I haved also tried Chorme and Edge, which appear to be unsatisfying. Such error of offset occurs mainly for the function of positioning differs in various browsers with different H5 attribute. Related explaination can be found in official documents and BBS of Baidu Earth Api.

## 
Basic understanding of event triggering and knowleges of API is what I believe to be the core of this homework. 

##
I have tried to come up with something much more interesting using this API, such as two men competing to find the shortest route(●'◡'●)(icons of two people can be seen). However, paces of people cannot be controled. I implemented moving of men by repositioning them to the KEY points, which is DIRECTLY offered by a function in Baidu API, on their route. Thus I cannot control the distances between two points.

I will be very gratified if you enlighten me about any idea to control the speed（*＾-＾*）
